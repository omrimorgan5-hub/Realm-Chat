# Chat Project

A full-stack real-time chat application built as part of my college application portfolio.
The project begins with JavaScript, then transitions to TypeScript as the codebase matures.
The backend will start with Flask for rapid prototyping before later migrating to Django for a more scalable, structured architecture.

This project will evolve over time, and I hope you follow along with the development journey.

## 🚀 Goals

Build a functioning real-time chat system from scratch

Learn and apply full-stack development skills

Demonstrate backend authentication, frontend UI, and real-time communication

Gradually increase code quality using TypeScript and Django

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)

Frontend

JavaScript → TypeScript

HTML & CSS

WebSockets for real-time messages

Backend (Phase 1)

Python Flask

JSON-based data storage → later SQL database

Email authentication

Backend (Phase 2)

Django migration

Django ORM / PostgreSQL

More advanced auth and security features

## 🗺 Roadmap

Note: These are estimates and subject to change.

Months 1–4

Build basic authentication (sign-up + login)

Set up the initial Flask backend

Implement email-based verification

Begin planning real-time messaging system structure

Month 5–8 (planned next phase)

Add WebSocket support for real-time chat

Create user profiles and basic UI

Store messages in a persistent database

Start refactoring frontend into TypeScript

Month 9–12 (future expansion)

Migrate backend from Flask → Django

Add more robust auth (password reset, sessions, tokens)

Improve UI/UX

Add features like group chats or message reactions

## 📁 Project Status

Currently in early development.
Core authentication and backend setup are in progress.
